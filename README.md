# brain_underlying_structure_identification

Project containing experiments made in Linear and NonLinear dynamical systems in order to infer the underlying structure of the brain

There's four folders:
- **Linear**: contains the experiments made in Linear dynamic systems regime
    -  ColoredNoise: experiments concerning systems with colored noise
    - DiagonalNoise: experiments concerning systems with diagonal noise
- **Models**: holds a variety of neural network models used in the experiments
- **NonLinear**: contains the experiments made in NonLinear dynamic systems regime
- **walkthrough**: simple tutorial of how to:
    - generate the adjacency and interaction matrix
    - generate the noise and the timeseries
    - generate our features
    - train the neural networks
    - compare our approach with popular estimators
