# brain_underlying_structure_identification

Project containing experiments made in Linear dynamical systems in order to infer the underlying structure of the LDS.

Folders:
- **walkthrough**: simple tutorial of how to:
    - generate the adjacency and interaction matrix
    - generate the noise and the timeseries
    - generate our features
    - train the neural networks
    - compare our approach with popular estimators
