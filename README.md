# brain_underlying_structure_identification

Project containing experiments made in Linear and NonLinear dynamical systems in order to infer the underlying structure of the brain

There's three folders:
    --> Linear: contains the experiments made in Linear dynamic systems regime
    --> Models: holds a variety of neural network models used in the experiments
    --> NonLinear: contains the experiments made in NonLinear dynamic systems regime
